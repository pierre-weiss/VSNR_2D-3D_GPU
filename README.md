This repository contains the sources and executables of the GPU based denoising codes of VSNR in 2D and 3D. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: you will be able to use this plugin only with NVIDIA Graphics cards since it is based on the CUDA programming language.

- For Windows 64 bits users:
0) to use precompiled dlls, make sure that CUDA 8.0 is installed
1) create a repository ~Fiji\plugins\VSNR, where ~Fiji indicates your Fiji repository.
2) copy the contents of precompiled\ in ~Fiji\plugins\VSNR

- For Linux & Mac & Windows 32 bits users:
you will need to recompile the library for your NVIDIA graphics card. Please follow the instructions given in vsnr_2D_gpu/README.txt and  vsnr_3D_gpu/README.txt.
